<behaviors-manifest>

  <purpose>
    Index of all available behaviors. The orchestrator reads this at session start to know
    what behaviors exist. Load individual behavior files on demand when composing agent
    instructions — do not read all behavior files upfront.
  </purpose>

  </behavior>

  <behavior name="scope-enforcement" file="behaviors/scope-enforcement.xml">
    File scope limits and out-of-scope discovery reporting. Prevents scope creep

  </behavior>

  <behavior name="response-format" file="behaviors/response-format.xml">
