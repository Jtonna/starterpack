<behavior name="response-format">

  <summary>
    Defines the standard response format for all agents during orchestration.
    Every message must be prefixed with the current lifecycle context so humans
    can track what phase is active during complex orchestrations.
  </summary>

  <applies-to>orchestrator, all agents</applies-to>

  <format>
    Every response during conversation or execution MUST begin with a lifecycle prefix:

    LIFECYCLE: {lifecycle-name} // {message}

    Examples:
      LIFECYCLE: ENTRY // Created ticket sp-04a: "Add logout button". Proceeding to PLANNING.
      LIFECYCLE: PLANNING // Launching explorer agent to build codebase context.
      LIFECYCLE: IMPLEMENTATION // 3/5 teammates complete. Waiting on sub-task 4 (auth module).
      LIFECYCLE: DOCS // Doc scout found 2 files needing updates. Launching auditors.
      LIFECYCLE: PR // Draft PR ready for review.

    When blocked at a human gate:
      LIFECYCLE: {lifecycle-name} // BLOCKED — waiting for your approval to proceed.

    When transitioning between lifecycles:
      LIFECYCLE: {from} → {to} // Transitioning from PLANNING to IMPLEMENTATION.
  </format>

  <rules>
    <rule>Every single response uses this format — no exceptions</rule>
    <rule>The lifecycle name must match the phase currently being executed</rule>
    <rule>Sub-agents reporting back to the orchestrator include their role in the message</rule>
    <rule>If work hasn't entered a lifecycle yet (e.g. initial greeting), use LIFECYCLE: IDLE</rule>
  </rules>

</behavior>
