  <summary>
    How sub-tasks are tracked as comments on beads tickets. Sub-tasks are NOT separate
    tickets — they are tracked as structured comments on the parent ticket.

  <rules>
    <rule>
      After plan approval in PLANNING, the orchestrator posts the approved sub-task list
      as a comment on the ticket: bd comment {ticket-id} "Sub-tasks: ..."
    </rule>
    <rule>
      During IMPLEMENTATION, the orchestrator (team lead) updates sub-task status as
      teammates report progress:
        [sub-task N] DONE: {description}
        [sub-task N] FAILED: {description} — {reason}
        [sub-task N] IN_PROGRESS: {description}
    </rule>
    <rule>
      Sub-task updates are posted as new comments on the ticket, not edits to existing comments.
      This preserves a timeline of progress.
    </rule>
  </rules>
