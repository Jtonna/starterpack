<lifecycle name="PR">

  <overview>
    Executed after documentation audit is complete. Creates the pull request and closes
    the beads ticket. All operations including git push and PR creation are delegated
    to sub-agents — the orchestrator never runs commands directly.

          Close the beads ticket with a close_reason summarizing what was done.
          TRUNK_BASED: close the single ticket.
          FEATURE_BRANCHING: close the epic ticket (all child tickets should already be
          closed during their individual workflow cycles). If any children are still open,
          flag this to the orchestrator before closing.
        </action>
        <action>
          After closing the ticket, ensure the beads changes (.beads/ files) are committed
          on the feature branch before the PR merges. The ticket closure will reach the
          default branch via the PR merge, and the GitHub Action will close the GitHub Issue
          at that point. No separate sync protocol is needed.
