  <description>
    The documentation model for projects using the starterpack. Defines file layouts
    for single projects and monorepos, plus documentation principles. Documentation
    should not be extensive — just enough to know how to dig around.

  <principles>
    <principle>README.md is the entry point and must reference docs/INDEX.md</principle>
    <principle>INDEX.md always exists and references every other doc file</principle>
    <principle>ARCHITECTURE.md is always present — gives the structural overview</principle>
    <principle>Think in services and systems — each gets its own doc</principle>
    <principle>Not extensive — just enough to navigate and understand the codebase</principle>
