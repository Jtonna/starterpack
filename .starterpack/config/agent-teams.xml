  <overview>
    The IMPLEMENTATION workflow uses Claude Code Agent Teams (experimental).
    This feature MUST be enabled in the project's Claude Code settings:
      { "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" } }
    The install script provisions this automatically in .claude/settings.local.json.
