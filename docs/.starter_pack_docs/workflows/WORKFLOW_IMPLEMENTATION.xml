<workflow name="IMPLEMENTATION">

  <overview>
    Executed after a plan is approved in the Planning workflow. The orchestrator launches
    a Swarm Manager to coordinate implementation agents. The orchestrator does NOT manage
    individual agents — the swarm manager handles dispatch, monitoring, and escalation.

        <action>
          The swarm manager creates the feature branch before dispatching any agents.
          Branch naming: look up the ticket's issue_type in docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/BEADS.xml issue-types
          to find the corresponding branch-prefix.
          Example: issue_type "feature" → branch-prefix "FEAT/" → git checkout -b FEAT/sp-0004
          See docs/.starter_pack_docs/workflows/BEADS.xml for the full issue_type to branch prefix mapping.
