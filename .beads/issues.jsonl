This should be a lightweight, non-destructive process.\n\n## Tasks\n- Research approaches: install script, npx/bunx CLI, git subtree, template repo, or manual copy\n- Decide on the best approach considering:\n  - Should not overwrite existing files without confirmation\n  - Should handle projects that already have a CLAUDE.md\n  - Should initialize beads if not already present\n  - Should set the prefix based on the target project name\n  - Must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux\n- Implement the chosen approach\n- Write installation instructions in README.md\n- Handle monorepo scenarios (multiple projects in one repo)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- A user can install the starterpack into an existing project with a single command or clear steps\n- Existing files are not overwritten without confirmation\n- Beads is initialized with the correct prefix\n- Works cross-platform","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"34466548+Jtonna@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-23T01:59:10.6688329-08:00","created_by":"Jacob Tonna","updated_at":"2026-02-23T01:59:10.6688329-08:00"}
