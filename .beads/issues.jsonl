{"id":"starterpack-23p","title":"Add autonomously-nightly tag with autonomous-readiness behavior","description":"Add a new add-on tag 'autonomously-nightly' that can be applied alongside any existing issue type (feature, bug, task). When present, it signals the ticket will be implemented by an AI agent running the full workflow autonomously with no human at the gates. Because of this, tickets with this tag must pass a 2-3 round Q\u0026A review protocol before being marked ready. Changes required: (1) Create new autonomous-readiness.xml behavior defining the Q\u0026A review protocol, (2) Register it in BEHAVIORS_MANIFEST.xml, (3) Update entry.xml to reference the behavior when the tag is present, (4) Update human-gate.xml autonomous-mode to reference autonomous-readiness as a prerequisite, (5) Add branch-prefix or tag handling in git-with-beads.xml for the add-on tag, (6) Add 'auto-nightly' GitHub label mapping in beads-sync.sh, (7) Document the new label in beads_sync.md.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"34466548+Jtonna@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-28T05:05:50.6079612-08:00","created_by":"Jacob Tonna","updated_at":"2026-02-28T05:05:50.6079612-08:00","labels":["autonomously-nightly"],"comments":[{"id":1,"issue_id":"starterpack-23p","author":"Jacob Tonna","text":"Sub-tasks:\n[sub-task 1] PENDING: Define autonomously-nightly label in git-with-beads.xml (light) — files: .starterpack/agent_instructions/behaviors/git-with-beads.xml\n[sub-task 2] PENDING: Add Q\u0026A rigor rules to human-gate.xml autonomous-mode section (standard) — files: .starterpack/agent_instructions/behaviors/human-gate.xml\n[sub-task 3] PENDING: Add auto-nightly label sync to beads-sync.sh (standard) — files: .github/scripts/beads-sync.sh\n[sub-task 4] PENDING: Document auto-nightly label in beads_sync.md (light) — files: .starterpack/beads_sync.md","created_at":"2026-02-28T17:22:46Z"}]}
