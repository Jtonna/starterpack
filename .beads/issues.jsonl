Add a step between file copy and auto-commit that checks the root .gitignore and removes/negates problematic patterns.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"34466548+Jtonna@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-26T06:40:21.9088777-08:00","created_by":"Jacob Tonna","updated_at":"2026-02-26T06:40:21.9088777-08:00"}
