{"id":"sp-m76","title":"Add pre-commit JSONL flush for Dolt backend","description":"After upgrading beads to v0.56.1 (Dolt backend), auto-flush to .beads/issues.jsonl no longer happens. Our GitHub Actions sync (beads-sync.yml) triggers on issues.jsonl changes, breaking the pipeline. Fix: add pre-commit hook logic that runs bd list --json, converts to JSONL, writes to issues.jsonl, and stages it. Also update git-with-beads.xml wording, update .beads/.gitignore for Dolt artifacts, and update install.ps1 if needed.","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"34466548+Jtonna@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-24T22:51:40Z","created_by":"Jacob Tonna","updated_at":"2026-02-24T22:51:48Z","dependency_count":0,"dependent_count":0,"comment_count":0}
